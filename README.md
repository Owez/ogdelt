# OGDELT

OGDELT is simplified GDELT. This project contains a language-abstract specification, as well as official implementations. 

## Bindings

The bindings for this project are currently non-existent and will be created after the specification is near completion. The roadmap is to get a Rust and then Python version complete.

## Specification

You can find the newest version of the specification [here]() or view a cutting-edge preview in the [`spec.md`](./spec.md) file.
